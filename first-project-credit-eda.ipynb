Future Works:**\n \n Some future reviews and improvements could be as the following:\n\n**Behavioral Analysis:**\n>Conduct a more in-depth analysis of customer spending behavior over time.\n\n**Market Segmentation:**\n>Explore further segmentation based on additional factors to refine targeting strategies.\n\n**Profitability Assessment:**\n>Evaluate the profitability of each credit card type to align offerings with customer preferences.\n\n**Customer Retention Strategies:**\n>Investigate strategies to enhance customer retention, given the observed disparity in transactions between existing and new customers.\n\n**Dynamic Credit Limit Adjustments:**\n>Investigate the possibility of dynamic credit limit adjustments based on evolving customer behavior and financial situations.\n\n*These recommendations and future investigation suggestions aim to enhance understanding and guide strategic decisions for improved business outcomes.*","metadata":{}}]}
